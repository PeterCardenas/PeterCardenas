# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I'm Peter! I'm a third-year Computer Science student at UT Austin.

I'm super interested in front-end web development, especially using React.

I'm previously worked at [Ladder](https://ladder.to) helping the next generation of professionals.

Currently I'm looking for new grad roles for Summer 2022!
